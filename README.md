## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** I used Next.js as a web development framework to create a fast and efficient website.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I used Tailwind CSS to design and style the user interface efficiently and customizably.

- **Shadcn:** Reusable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

- **AWS Lambda and SES:** I implemented a Lambda function on AWS to handle the contact form, and I use Simple Email Service (SES) to send emails.
